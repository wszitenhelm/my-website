Freelance Life: Building & Winning

Officially calling myself a freelance blockchain engineer now. The hustle is real: client work during the day, hackathon projects at night. Just delivered a ZK-proof prototype for a privacy startup. The freedom to choose projects I'm passionate about is worth the unstable income (for now). Every new contract I write, every architecture I design – I'm building my own reputation, one commit at a time.</p></div>

Second Hackathon, Second Win: ETHWarsaw Base Bounty

Can't believe it – won again! This time at ETHWarsaw with a tutor-student matching dApp on Base. The challenge was creating trustless connections without a central platform. Built the smart contract to handle deposits, matching, and release payments. Watching real people test it and say "this actually makes sense" was the best validation. Two hackathons, two wins. Maybe I'm not just pretending to know this stuff after all.  </p>          </div>

Cross-Chain Breakthrough: EVM ↔ SVM Working!

IT WORKS! After weeks of wrestling with Chainlink CCIP, I finally got a token to move from Ethereum to Solana and back. The moment my test transaction completed and I saw the balance update on the other chain... I actually yelled in my apartment. The architecture is wild – Solidity contracts handling logic on one side, Anchor programs on the other, with CCIP as the messenger. So much debugging, so many failed transactions. But today, it works. 🚀              </p>

The Lonely Grind: Cross-Chain Project Getting Real

Okay, reality check. This cross-chain project is HARD. Working solo means when I hit a wall (like today's CCIP gas estimation issue), there's no one to bounce ideas off. Spent 6 hours debugging why messages weren't being received on Solana. Turns out I was serializing payloads wrong. The learning curve is vertical, but every small victory feels huge. The documentation gaps between EVM and SVM ecosystems are real. Drinking more coffee than water.              </p>

Just back from NBX Warsaw – my first proper web3 conference! Presented my cross-chain project to actual builders, not just academics. The feedback was incredible ("Have you considered the MEV implications?" – I hadn't). Met people working on problems I didn't even know existed. The energy here is different from traditional tech conferences. Less corporate, more "let's build the future." Came back with 20 new ideas and a confirmed belief: this is where I belong.

Solidity vs Rust: Building the Same Thing Twice


                </h3>
              </a>
              <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-[#9CA3AF] line-clamp-3">
For my internal project, I built the same e-voting system in both Solidity (Ethereum) and Rust+Anchor (Solana). The experience was enlightening:

Solidity: Felt like home. The EVM model is straightforward – state variables, functions, events. But gas optimization makes my brain hurt sometimes.

Rust + Anchor: Like learning to write with my other hand. The account model, PDA derivation, instruction handlers – completely different mindset. More verbose, but incredibly explicit.

Both have their beauty. Solidity for quick iteration, Rust for when you need that extra control. Now I understand why multi-chain is the future – different tools for different jobs.

My advisor wants me to pick something "established" – cloud computing, ML, something with clear job prospects. But all I can think about is web3.
